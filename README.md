Problem 1: Radioactive Decay
  The isotope Bi_213 decays to a stable Bi_209 via two different routes. 
  There is a 2.09% chance of is decaying to Tl_209 and a 97.91% chance of decaying to Pb_209. 
  Afterwards Tl_209 decays to Pb_209 and all of the Pb_209 decays to Bi_209. 
  The program then creates a graph and the graph was uploaded into this folder, along with the code. 
  The number of each element after running the code is included at the bottom of the program.
  Note: Due to the program being random, you will not be able to identically duplicate the number I got for the number of elements at the end of the code.
  
  
Problem 2: Monte Carlo integration
